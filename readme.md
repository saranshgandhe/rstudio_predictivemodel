Overview

Welcome to the R Studio Predictive Analysis Project! This repository documents the code, data, and insights from a predictive analysis conducted using R Studio. The project involved building Multiple Linear Regression, Gaussian Regression, and Neural Network models to analyze a dataset comprising both qualitative and quantitative variables. Visualizations were created using Power BI, and regular coordination ensured the successful delivery of weekly milestones.
Project Description

The primary objective of this project was to conduct a predictive analysis on a given dataset to gain valuable insights. The project workflow can be summarized as follows:

    Data Ingestion: We started by importing the raw data into R Studio. The dataset was carefully processed to ensure it was clean and suitable for analysis.

    Model Building: Three types of predictive models were constructed - Multiple Linear Regression, Gaussian Regression, and Neural Network models. These models were trained using appropriate methodologies to assess their accuracy in predicting outcomes.

    Visualization using Power BI: To communicate the findings effectively, interactive visualizations were created using Power BI. These visualizations aided stakeholders in understanding complex patterns and relationships within the data.

    Weekly Coordination: Collaboration played a crucial role in the project's success. Regular coordination with four team members took place through virtual meetings and communication tools to ensure timely progress and address any challenges.

Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

    Data: Contains the raw data files used for analysis.

    Scripts: Includes R scripts for data ingestion, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

    Models: Stores saved models generated during analysis.

    Power BI: Contains Power BI files and visualizations presented to stakeholders.

    Documentation: Holds project-related documents, including this README file, requirements, and reference materials.

    Deliverables: Contains weekly reports submitted to stakeholders with progress updates and accomplishments.

Getting Started

To reproduce the results and analyses of this project, follow these steps:

    Clone or download the entire repository to your local machine.

    Ensure R and R Studio are installed, along with any required packages specified in the R scripts.

    Load the raw data files from the "Data" directory into R Studio for analysis.

    Execute the R scripts in the "Scripts" directory in the specified order to preprocess the data and build the models.

    The trained models will be saved in the "Models" directory, which can be used for predictions or further analysis.

    To visualize the insights, open the Power BI files in the "Power BI" directory. Make sure you have Power BI Desktop installed.

Model Building

The predictive analysis involved building three types of models:

    Multiple Linear Regression: A model to analyze the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable.

    Gaussian Regression: A model to predict the distribution of continuous variables.

    Neural Network: A model to identify complex patterns using artificial neural networks.

Each model's accuracy and performance were evaluated to select the best model for the given dataset.
Visualization using Power BI

The insights gained from the analysis were presented using interactive visualizations created in Power BI. These visualizations allowed stakeholders to explore the data and understand key findings effectively.
Weekly Coordination

Regular coordination with the team members was maintained through virtual meetings and communication tools. This facilitated the successful completion of weekly deliverables, efficient problem-solving, and overall project progress.
