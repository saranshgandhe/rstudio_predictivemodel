**Overview**

Welcome to the R Studio Predictive Analysis Project! This repository documents the code, data, and insights from a predictive analysis conducted using R Studio in the form of a powerpoint presentation. The project involved building Multiple Linear Regression, Gaussian Regression, and Neural Network models to analyze a dataset comprising both qualitative and quantitative variables. Visualizations were created using Power BI, and regular coordination ensured the successful delivery of weekly milestones.

**Project Description**

The primary objective of this project was to conduct a predictive analysis on a given dataset to gain valuable insights. The project workflow can be summarized as follows:

    Data Ingestion: We started by importing the raw data into R Studio. The dataset was carefully processed to ensure it was clean and suitable for analysis.

    Model Building: Three types of predictive models were constructed - Multiple Linear Regression, Gaussian Regression, and Neural Network models. These models were trained using appropriate methodologies to assess their accuracy in predicting outcomes.

    Visualization using Power BI: To communicate the findings effectively, interactive visualizations were created using Power BI. These visualizations aided stakeholders in understanding complex patterns and relationships within the data.

    Weekly Coordination: Collaboration played a crucial role in the project's success. Regular coordination with four team members took place through virtual meetings and communication tools to ensure timely progress and address any challenges.

**Project Structure**

The repository is organized into the following directories:

    insurance.csv: Contains the raw data files used for analysis.

    Insurance-Regression.R: Includes R scripts for data ingestion, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
    
    Maple - Capstone project part 3: Contains report submitted to stakeholders with progress updates and accomplishments.

**Model Building**

The predictive analysis involved building three types of models:

    Multiple Linear Regression: A model to analyze the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable.

    Gaussian Regression: A model to predict the distribution of continuous variables.

    Neural Network: A model to identify complex patterns using artificial neural networks.

Each model's accuracy and performance were evaluated to select the best model for the given dataset.

**Visualization using Power BI**

The insights gained from the analysis were presented using interactive visualizations created in Power BI. These visualizations allowed stakeholders to explore the data and understand key findings effectively.

**Weekly Coordination**

Regular coordination with the team members was maintained through virtual meetings and communication tools. This facilitated the successful completion of weekly deliverables, efficient problem-solving, and overall project progress.

**Conclusion**

Thank you for your interest in this R Studio Predictive Analysis Project. I hope the models and visualizations provide valuable insights to stakeholders. Should you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.

Let's keep learning and growing together!
